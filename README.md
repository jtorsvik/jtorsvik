## My Professional Summary

I'm a Data Scientist for BaneNOR SF, governmental company that owns, develops and maintains the Norwegian railway infrastructure. As a data scientist for railway company, my job is to solve various problems that can be solved with artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as predictive maintenance, computer vision for object detection and image classification, and NLP to read unstructured texts and documentation.

I have previously worked in Data Engineering and Data Science for Equinor ASA, an energy company that works with oil and renewable energy around the world. I have also studied Data Science (MSc) at the University of Sussex in England, where I were taught Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Image Processing.
