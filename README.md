# Welcome to the Repository of Joakim Martin Torsvik (@jtorsvik).

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist for BaneNOR SF in Norway, a railway company where my job is to apply machine learning to various issues within the industry.
I have previously worked in Data Engineering and Data Science for Equinor ASA, an energy company that works with oil and renewable energy around the world. I have also studied Data Science (MSc) at the University of Sussex in England, where I were taught Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Image Processing. 

Please feel free to look around my private repository and let me know if there is anything interesting, *"eye-brow raising"*, or simply logically wrong with my projects. Any constructive or corrective comments will be met with love and appreciation! :)
