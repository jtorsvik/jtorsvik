# Welcome to the Repository of Joakim Martin Torsvik (@jtorsvik).

I'm currently working as a data consultant for Sopra Steria AS in Norway within Data Science and Data Engineering.
I have previously studied Data Science (MSc) at the University of Sussex in England, where I were taught Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Image Processing (with more). 

Please feel free to look around my private repository and let me know if there is anything interesting, *"eye-brow raising"*, or simply logically wrong with my projects. Any constructive or corrective comments will be met with love and appreciation! :)
